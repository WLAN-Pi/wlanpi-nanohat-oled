# wlanpi-nanohat-oled
WLANPi OLED display menu/navigation system

This project aims to provide a more useful and flexible front-panel menu/navigation system for the WLANPi than is provided by default with the unit. This will allow more useful information to be displayed and various modes and settings to be configured from the front panel when network access if not available/possible.

The project is currently a single Python script that has been created using the principles of operation shown in the default file supplied with the hardware unit. The file, by default, is called "bakebit_nanohat_oled.py" and will continue with the same name in this project.

## Status

This project is still in an early development cycle, so code is likely to change (and break) often.

## Installation

If you would like to have a look at the current menu system on your WLANPi, download the "bakebit_nanohat_oled.py" file from this project and copy it to your WLANPi directory "/home/wlanpi/NanoHatOLED/BakeBit/Software/Python". It's probably a good idea to make a backup of you existing "bakebit_nanohat_oled.py" before copying in the new file.

Once the file is installed, reboot the WLANPi and the new menu system should be visible on the OLED display.
